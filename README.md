# Attend, Infer, Repeat: Fast Scene Understanding with Generative Models

This is an **unofficial** Tensorflow implementation of Attend, Infear, Repeat (AIR), as presented in the following paper:
[S. M. Ali Eslami](http://arkitus.com/) et. al., [Attend, Infer, Repeat: Fast Scene Understanding with Generative Models](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6230-attend-infer-repeat-fast-scene-understanding-with-generative-models).

* **Author (of the implementation)**: Adam Kosiorek, Oxford Robotics Institue, University of Oxford
* **Email**: adamk(at)robots.ox.ac.uk
* **Webpage**: http://akosiorek.github.io/

I describe the implementation and the issues I run into while working on it in [this blog post](http://akosiorek.github.io/ml/2017/09/03/implementing-air.html).


## Installation
Install [Tensorflow v1.1.0rc1](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.1/install/), [Sonnet v1.1](https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet/tree/3fd7d9d342d9683df83a44ebd048ef0d5668266b) and the following dependencies
 (using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (preferred) or `pip install [package]`):
* matplotlib==1.5.3
* attrdict==2.0.0
* scipy==0.18.1
* pillow==5.3.0

## Sample Results

AIR learns to reconstruct objects by painting them one by one in a blank canvas. The below figure comes from a model trained for 175k iterations; the maximum number of steps is set to 3, but there are never more than 2 objects.
The first row shows the input images, rows 2-4 are reconstructions at steps 1, 2 and 3 (with marked location of the attention glimpse in red, if it exists). Rows 4-7 are the reconstructed image crops, and above each crop is the
probability of executing 1, 2 or 3 steps. If the reconstructed crop is black and there is "0 with ..." written above it, it means that this step was not used.

## Data  
Run `./scripts/create_dataset.sh`
The script creates train and validation datasets of multi-digit MNIST.

## Training
Run `./scripts/train_multi_mnist.sh`
The training script will run for 300k iteratios and will save model checkpoints and training progress figures every 10k iterations in `results/multi_mnist`. Tensorflow summaries are also stored in the same folder and Tensorboard can be used for monitoring.

The model seems to be very sensitive to initialisation. It might be necessary to run training multiple times before achieving count step accuracy close to the one reported in the paper.

## Experimentation
The jupyter notebook available at `attend_infer_repeat/experiment.ipynb` can be used for experimentation.
